## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/KarunakarThurlu/DataStructures-Algorithms.git
2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code).
3. ✅ Each problem includes **JUnit 5 test cases**.
4. ▶️ Run the test classes to execute and verify the logic.
5. ℹ️ There is **no `main` method** — all implementations are validated through unit tests.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Testing framework used: **JUnit 5**
- All logic is verified using structured unit tests.
- Modify or add new test cases to experiment with different inputs.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository

- Write clean and understandable Java code
- Practice frequently asked interview problems
- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
- Maintain a structured DSA reference
